# House-Price-Prediction
We aim to predict house prices using linear regression, a widely used supervised learning algorithm. We start by collecting data from Kaggle, perform extensive data cleaning to eliminate outliers, and ensure data accuracy. After preprocessing, we create a linear regression model and choose the Ridge model for its performance, achieving an accuracy score above 80%. We export this model and location information for use in the frontend.
The frontend of our application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, allowing users to input features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and location to estimate house prices. The Flask server serves as the backend, interacting with the model and delivering predictions. Our model preprocessing involves one-hot encoding for location and feature scaling. Finally, we apply linear regression using a pipeline, making predictions straightforward.
House price prediction using linear regression involves data collection, preprocessing (handling missing data, scaling, and encoding), splitting data into training and testing sets, model creation, evaluation (using metrics like MSE and RMSE), prediction, and potential optimization through hyperparameter tuning or advanced regression techniques. Building a robust model may require more extensive preprocessing and feature engineering with a representative dataset for accurate predictions.
